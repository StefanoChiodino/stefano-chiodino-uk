These are some of the acronyms that I've come across working at NHS Digital in less than a year. As I gain confidence in the domain knowledge I find myself using them more and more, and even tempted to create some myself! But I still vividly remember when I was a newbie and most of these acronyms were a barrier.

The more I work in the computer software industry the more I realise cognitive load is the name of the game. Yet we decide to save ourselves what may be one second a day by abbreviating a few words, at the cost of raising a wall for new employees.

Good sense dictate you call your variable `pageTitle`, rather than calling it `pt`. Yet we are ok to abbreviate very complicated groups of words out of our programs source code as if we still had screen accommodating just 80 characters per line.

I can recall the head of DevOps of my previous company telling about how the scripts were setup using verbose flags like `--allow` instead of `-a`, so that they could be picked up by anybody more easily.
