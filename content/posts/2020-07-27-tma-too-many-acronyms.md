One day Chris, head of devops, gave me a tour of our setup. He proudly pointed out to me how they prefer to write arguments using the long version, like `--allow` instead of `-a`. This is to make it easier to understand the system, and thus maintain it. It made so much sense: decrease the cognitive load, increase productivity.

Then I started working for the NHS, the biggest employer in the UK, and 5th in the world, just after McDonald's. Seems like in such a big company nobody has time to spell things out, so here are some acronyms I've come across:

AHAS, SME, PO, CDS, ECDS, APC, EM, OP, EC, NCC, PCC, DSCRO, AE, BAU, BA, CQUIN, CC, DAE, DDC, DLP, DSP, DPS, GPDC, GDPPR, HES, HSCIC, MESH, MPS, NHSE, NHSD, NTS, PbR, PHE, RFA, RFC, SEM, SUS, S&T, VMOST...

Good sense dictates you should call your variable `pageTitle`, rather than `pt`. So why is it ok to abbreviate `GPES Data for Pandemic Planning and Research` to GDPPR, in a nested acronym?

I took a business writing course recently, and one of the key points was that you have to write for your audience. Look, I get it. I review a lot of `merge requests`, and the temptation to call them `MR` is strong, but think about your audience. Are you in a group chat with your Product Owner and the New Starter? Do the right thing and make it easy for everybody.

When you are writing to your colleague in private use all the acronyms you are confident they know. Just don't get used to it.
