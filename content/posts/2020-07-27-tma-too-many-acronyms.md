TLDR: Acronyms are not evil, but the inclination of abbreviating everything all the time should be curbed, especially when writing things down in more formal documents or for the benefits of junior team members of the team.

AHAS, SME, PO, CDS, ECDS, APC, EM, OP, EC, NCC, PCC, DSCRO, AE, BAU, BA, CQUIN, CC, DAE, DDC, DLP, DSP, DPS, GPDC, GDPPR, HES, HSCIC, MESH, MPS, NHSE, NHSD, NTS, PbR, PHE, RFA, RFC, SEM, SUS, S&T, VMOST.

These are some of the acronyms that I've come across working at NHS Digital in less than a year. As I gain confidence in the domain knowledge I find myself using them more and more, and even tempted to create some myself! But I still vividly remember when I was a newbie and most of these acronyms were a barrier.

The more I work in the computer software industry the more I realise cognitive load is the name of the game. Yet we decide to save ourselves what may be one second a day by abbreviating a few words, at the cost of raising a wall for new employees.

Good sense dictate you call your variable `pageTitle`, rather than calling it `pt`. Yet we are ok to abbreviate very complicated groups of words out of our programs source code as if we still had screen accommodating just 80 characters per line.

I can recall the head of DevOps of my previous company telling about how the scripts were setup using verbose flags like `--allow` instead of `-a`, so that they could be picked up by anybody more easily.

Believe it or not I've recently came across GDPPR which, beside sounding terribly like GDPR, it's also plagued by by being a recursive acronym (GPES Data for Pandemic Planning and Research).
