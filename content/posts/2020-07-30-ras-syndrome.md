I recall a friend complaining about "PAT test", because PAT already stands for Portable Appliance Test, so adding test at the end was redundant.

I've eventually came across the [RAS syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome), which is a self-referential name for this problem.

Other common cases of RAS syndrome are PIN and VIN numbers, ATM machine, HIV virus, LCD display.

Acronyms suffering from RAS syndromes are widely accepted as the redundancy adds clarity.
