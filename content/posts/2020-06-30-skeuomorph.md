A skeuomorph is an object that maintained design cues that have become non functional. For example the tiny handle on maple syrup bottle is to retain the distinctive appearance of the much bigger jugs maple syrup was once stored in. Other examples are many icons on modern mobile phones and computers, light bulbs in the shape of candles, etc.
