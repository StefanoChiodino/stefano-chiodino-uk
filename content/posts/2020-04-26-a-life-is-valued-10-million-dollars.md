In the USA the value of a life has been estimated to be worth 10 million USD. This was initially much smaller, being just what a person would earn for the rest of his life, in average. It was later adjusted to reflect what a human life is worth, other than just work, by calculating how much the market values the danger of more risky job to be worth, but also what is it worth to their dears.
