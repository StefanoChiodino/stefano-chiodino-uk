tldr:
  - "Monocots have one cotyledon, parallel leaf veins, fibrous roots, and floral parts in multiples of three."
  - "Dicots have two cotyledons, branching leaf veins, a taproot system, and floral parts in multiples of four or five."
  - "Their vascular systems also differ: monocots have complex arrangements while dicots have ring-based ones."

Dicots and monocots differs on several more features other than the one that gives them their names: the number of cotyledon (leafs) in their embryo. Monocots have parallel veins in their leafs, which usually means elongate leafs as well, complexly arranged vascular system, fibrous roots, and floral parts usually in multiple of three. Dicots have a network of branching veins, a vascular system arranged in rings, a taproot system (a long main root), and floral parts usually arranged in multiple of four or five.
